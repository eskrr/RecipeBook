Scatter with half the thyme and roast for 20-25 mins until tender and lightly charred. When roasting vegetables, use a large baking tray with low sides and space them well apart. This allows them to roast rather than steam, giving you lovely crisp edges. Not a fan of cauliflower? Try broccoli florets instead.",

Simply mix the ingredients in the pan and gently heat while you make the omelette, then  season well and place over a medium-low heat for 5 mins, stirring occasionally, until smooth and combined. Cover and set aside. Any leftovers can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days and reheated in the same way.",

Pour in the egg mixture, lightly spread with a spatula to evenly cover the base of the pan, then season and cover with the lid. Cook for 4-5 mins until the bottom of the omelette is golden and set and the top is pale but lightly set. Covering the pan with a lid helps the top of the omelette to set, so you don’t end up with raw, foamy egg. No lid? Use an ovenproof pan and grill for 30 secs to set. Slide a spatula around the omelette to loosen, then gently transfer to a plate. Cover half with the roasted cauliflower and spoon over the cheese sauce. Scatter with the parsley, remaining thyme leaves and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Fold the omelette over on itself and cut in half to serve.",
